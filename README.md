# KenoSystem
System for state-wide keno gaming

This is a fully functional networked keno gaming system. It was intended to be run from 
bars or any other location with Internet access that has video poker/slots; taking
advantage of the Internet connection. It is perfectly legal because it is a free-play
system. Payout funds come from a portion of the monthly subscription fee charged to
the location owner.

With enough locations in the network, the pot can become quite attractive. 

The system can be program to pay out based on the number of number matches. The higher
the number of matches required; the number of combinations and less likely a full 
match/payout. For a frequent payout, the system could be set to match only three
numbers.

The system, being networked, knows where all tickets are played, what numbers are
played, and by whom. Players must register with a valid ID to collect a payout over
a preset amount (to prevent insider payouts); this can be set to even one dollar.

Real-time number draws are displayed at each location. If a player at a location wins,
the location is notified and the player must collect with a fixed time period. Uncollected
winnings return to the pot.

The system can also be used for stand alone keno number drawing at a VFW or similar "club".

DISCLAIMER: This system is NOT a gabling system since no player places bets. Each player
receives free-play tickets after purchase of a beverage at the location or for just
walking in the door; depends how the netwokr opertor sets it up.
