# KenoSystem
System for state-wide keno gaming

This is a fully functional networked keno gaming system. It was intended to be run from 
bars or any other location with Internet access that has video poker/slots; taking
advantage of the Internet connection. It is perfectly legal because it is a free-play
system. Payout funds come from a portion of the monthly subscription fee charged to
the location owner or system operator.

With enough locations in the network, the pot can become quite attractive. 

The system can be programmed to pay out based on the number of matches. The higher
the number of matches required; the higher number of combinations, and less likely a full 
match/payout. For a frequent payout, the system could be set to match fewer numbers.

The system, being networked, knows where all tickets are played, what numbers are
played, and by whom. Players must register with a valid ID to collect a payout over
a preset amount (to prevent insider payouts); the minimum amount is selectable.

Real-time number draws are displayed at each location. If a player at a location wins,
the location is notified and the player must collect within a fixed time period. Uncollected
winnings return to the pot. All winning tickets' numbers are displayed in real-time
at each location. For public viewing, there is a screen for the numbers drawn,
and a results/matches screen. There can be multiple displays at a location.

Tickets are printed on a thermal printer or any other printer desired as long as
the barcode and encrypted 3D code can be scanned. Since each ticket has an encrypted
validation code, it is not possible to create a fradulent ticket. In addition, the
ephemeral nature of the data inherently prevents fraud.

The system can also be used for stand alone keno-number drawing at a VFW or similar "club".

DISCLAIMER: This system is NOT a gambling system since no player places bets. Each player
receives free-play tickets after purchase of a beverage at the location or for just
walking in the door; depends how the network operator sets it up.
